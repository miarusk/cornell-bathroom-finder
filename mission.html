										<h2>The Team's Mission Statement</h2>	
										<p>Navigating campus buildings can be challenging, especially when restroom facilities are inconsistent and difficult to find. Hollister Hall, where men's and women's restrooms alternate by floor, exemplifies a broader issue across Cornell’s campus—many older buildings were not designed to meet modern accessibility and user needs.</p>

											
										<p> Cornell’s current restroom directory focuses only on single-occupant bathrooms and provides locations using coordinates rather than intuitive directions. It often lacks crucial details like accessibility features, amenities, and real-time availability, leaving users without the information needed to make informed choices.<p>

										<p>This gap becomes more significant as bathroom preferences and expectations evolve. Modern facilities prioritize full-height partitions, touchless fixtures, personal item storage, and enhanced privacy. Without an effective directory, students waste time and experience unnecessary frustration searching for suitable restrooms.<p>

										<p>Our solution addresses these challenges through a dynamic database system linked to an embedded Excel sheet. Users can filter restrooms by criteria such as gender designation, accessibility features, and amenities, transforming how students navigate campus spaces.<p>
										
										<p>Even in its early stages, our prototype surpasses Cornell’s existing directory by enabling searches for women’s, gender-neutral, ADA-compliant, and single-occupancy restrooms. Its flexible structure supports future expansions, ensuring the system grows with user needs.<p>

										<p>This directory is more than a tool—it’s a step toward creating a more accessible, user-friendly campus. By providing accurate, up-to-date restroom information, we empower students to plan their time and spaces efficiently, improving both their immediate and long-term campus experiences.<p>
