										<h2 id="content">What is ENGRC 3500?</h2>
										<p>ENGRG 3500, Engineering Communications, is a transformative course offered at Cornell University that empowers students to excel in professional communication within technical and interdisciplinary contexts. The course bridges the gap between technical expertise and effective communication, emphasizing teamwork, leadership, and project management skills. Students apply their knowledge through real-world projects that address community challenges, preparing them to be impactful engineers and leaders.</p>

										<h2 id="content">Our Goal</h2>
										<p>Our goal is to enhance bathroom accessibility and usability across Cornell’s campus by developing innovative tools that address the evolving needs of students. We aim to create a comprehensive, user-friendly bathroom directory that provides accurate information about amenities, accessibility features, and navigation. Historically, many campus buildings, especially those in engineering and other STEM fields, were designed at a time when these disciplines had predominantly male populations, resulting in a lack of facilities for women and non-binary individuals. By addressing these historical oversights, we strive to reduce the stress and inefficiencies associated with locating suitable restrooms, fostering a more comfortable and equitable campus environment for everyone.</p>
